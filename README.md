# PBKDF2-identifier

This is a tool to identify the parameters used to generate a PBKDF2 hash. Useful to defeat the good old "Security by Obscurity".
Right now it is able to identify the number of iterations of a hash if the algorithm is already known, but this will be done soon.
This will also be made as a CLI tool and a webassembly module.
